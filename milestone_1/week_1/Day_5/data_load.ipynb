    "## 🧭 Data Loading — USGS Global Earthquake Dataset (1900–Present)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains detailed information on significant global earthquakes \n",
    "(magnitude ≥ 5.0) recorded since 1900. Sourced weekly from the United States \n",
    "Geological Survey (USGS), it includes comprehensive data such as timestamp, \n",
    "location (latitude & longitude), magnitude, depth, and measurement network details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earthquakes originate from tectonic activity across both highly seismic regions, such \n",
    "as the Pacific Ring of Fire, and less active zones like Europe and Africa. The dataset \n",
    "serves as a valuable resource for analyzing long-term seismic patterns, understanding \n",
    "geological behavior, and developing predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Columns Explained:\n",
    "- **time**: Timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch (UTC) representing event occurrence.\n",
    "- **latitude / longitude**: Coordinates of the earthquake's epicenter (in decimal degrees).\n",
    "- **depth**: Depth of the event in kilometers.\n",
    "- **mag**: Reported earthquake magnitude.\n",
    "- **magType**: Type of magnitude measurement (e.g., mb, ml, mw).\n",
    "- **nst**: Number of stations used to compute the earthquake solution.\n",
    "- **gap**: Largest azimuthal gap between stations, in degrees.\n",
    "- **dmin**: Distance to the nearest recording station (in degrees).\n",
    "- **rms**: Root-mean-square residual of seismic station readings.\n",
    "- **net / id**: Network and unique event identifiers.\n",
    "- **updated**: Last update timestamp for the event record.\n",
    "- **place**: Human-readable location description.\n",
    "- **type**: Event type (e.g., “earthquake”, “explosion”, “quarry blast”).\n",
    "- **horizontalError / depthError / magError**: Uncertainty measurements of calculations.\n",
    "- **status**: Event status within USGS catalog (e.g., “reviewed”, “automatic”).\n",
    "- **locationSource / magSource**: Networks providing the location and magnitude data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset supports exploratory analyses, time-series pattern detection, and \n",
    "predictive-modeling of seismic events worldwide, making it highly applicable to \n",
    "earthquake research and risk assessment projects.\n",
